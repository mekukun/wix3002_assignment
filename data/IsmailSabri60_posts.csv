@TropicLibra,All are silly planted issues lined up for debate. PM Ismail Sabri PM can talk to Muhyiddin the PN chairman which is the biggest coalition in the current govt.on calling for a GE15. Not an issue to be debated since umno doesn't hold the key to dissolve the current govt.,"Mar 17, 2022"
@TropicLibra,"And Ismail is one of the 5 Vice presidents of Umno. He is holding a top umno post. You probably don't know that Umno is divided into 2 factions. The corrupt kleptocrat Najib / Zahid faction, & the Ismail Sabri faction. Umno should call for a party election to get rid of Zahid.","Mar 18, 2022"
@TropicLibra,"Annuar Musa and Ismail Sabri ride on the back of PN to promote Umno interests esp Annuar Musa who as KKom Minister ensures RTM gives 100% coverage to Umno Ministers and nothing on Bersatu, Pas or PN Ministers as a whole. He and NurJazlan are all the same.","Oct 13, 2022"
@TropicLibra,"Because the dress code for the meeting is smart casual. PM Lee is wearing shirt , jacket without a neck tie. But I do think Ismail Sabri's choice of casual is tacky. Looks like a Mickey mouse outfit.","May 28, 2022"
@TropicLibra,Bersatu should keep its option opened. It should not be excited abt Ismail Sabri being named PM candidate by Umno. Bersatu should put Muhyiddin as its calun PM. Umno with old faces cannot be trusted as a political partner. They caused the resignation of TSMY as PM.,"Apr 16, 2022"
@TropicLibra,"Don't say says PM. Should state "" says the VP of Umno, caretaker PM Ismail Sabri. "" That will be more apt. PM cannot comment on related GE proposal. Don't they teach Star reporters that in school? ","Oct 25, 2022"
@TropicLibra,Muhyiddin & the PN MPs can call Umno's bluff & leave the Federal govt. The govt will collapse & the PM who happens to be from Umno will fall like a house of cards together with Umno Ministers. No need to wait for Ismail Sabri to call for GE.,"Mar 18, 2022"
@TropicLibra,Muhyiddin can topple Ismail Sabri anytime.  He & Bersatu/PN could just leave the current govt & it will collapse like a house of cards. He was most likely discussing about the ' big tent' cooperation in GE15 to deny Umno of victory rather than to be PM again now.,"Jun 6, 2022"

@TropicLibra,Pulak. Why you want to represent Zahid? Scared you won't be chosen by Zahid to defend your parliamentary seat in GE15 ? Ismail Sabri is the worst PM ever. He rides on the backs of PN support yet acts as if Umno commands 2/3 majority in Parliament.,"Aug 22, 2022"
@TropicLibra,Rubbish statement by Umno no.2. His statements are self serving and directly blaming PN govt under Muhyiddin and current govt under Ismail Sabri. This no 2 did nothing to help the nation during the pandemic. He can spew rubbish because he is not the type to take responsibility.,"Mar 17, 2022"

@TropicLibra,That's the way it should be. Ismail Sabri 's BN has only 42 seats in Parliament whereas PN led by Bersatu has 72 seats. Ismail Sabri's position as PM is propped up by PN. BN must thank PN for it.,"Apr 12, 2022"
@TropicLibra,The govt? I thought it was just PM Ismail Sabri who struck a deal with PH. Don't know who gave him the mandate. He is PM riding on the back of Perikatan Nasional.,"Sep 14, 2022"
@TropicLibra,Umno is divided into Zahid/Najib faction & Ismail Sabri faction. The faction that has issues with Pas is the arrogant syiok sendiri Zahid faction. Ismail Sabri can work with PN ( that comprises Pas ). In fact Umno relies on 72 PN seats to stay afloat in Federal govt.,"Mar 17, 2022"

@TropicLibra,Yeah right. Just that he is the PM because Muhyiddin Yassin and the PN MPs have chosen to stick to being in the govt. BN and Umno own seats cannot prop up Ismail Sabri. So it is strange that some in Umno think the govt is an Umno/ BN govt. It is not.,"May 17, 2022"
