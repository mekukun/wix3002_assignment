@2daMoonz,Ramesh Rao being dead is a real red flag to me. And Zahid suddenly changing tune. Perhaps UMNO as a whole is a victim to some powerful bidder. Qustion is is it even done by the locals? Or could it be sth bigger like freemason... If my interpretation is correct...,Jan 15
@2daMoonz,That's why Zahid chose PH. Bcs with PN they'll be swallowed whole. Even within BN there's PN faction. Skrg masa mkn popcorn and enjoy the show. My guess if everthibg goes well Najib and Zahid will be a free man this coming year. And Anwar can't do anything about that.,Jan 5
@2daMoonz,Zahid will be free along with Najib. But for that to happen PN needs to become formidable contender to PH. May 92.5 billion scdal doesn't taint PN bcs its in UMNO's best interest that PH coalition be shaky so that they are desperate to restore Malay's trust by releasing Najib.,Jan 16

@DolRizal,Too simplistic. Who is “another leader”? If Zahid goes down (legal cases) then Tok Mat will take over. He’s unlikely to make overtures to PN. The only existing (non-sacked/suspended) Umno leader who’d sell Umno to PN is Ismail Sabri. His path to taking over the party is tricky.,Feb 9

@NarenDharan19,Zahid is doing none of it all he cares is how to clear himself from charges and add more fortunes to his family members. What I really don’t know is how so many umno leaders are allowing him to do what he is doing today.,Feb 6
@Nash_ANJ,"Amin .

I do like that BN and PH have to work together. Just the outcome could have been different if Anwar could have out negotiated Zahid and left MoF. If you gamed it out ada je cara.

@PerisaiPejuang,No not so. You can plan for several scenarios. Sure Anwar can have a plan where Zahid isn't TPM if he won majority solely. And he could plan for working together with UMNO had he not win majority. And he has planned with UMNO. And it's always the most likely that they had to coop,Apr 25
@PerisaiPejuang,So position trumps morality? The fact that he is UMNO president doesn't diminish the immorality of appointing him as TPM. You can claim that Mudin is unethical as well but it still doesn't mean that appointing Zahid as TPM isn't immoral. Two wrongs,Apr 25
@PerisaiPejuang,Sorry yeah. What I meant to say was anti hopping law doesn't cause reelection just because they voted differently from what the president commanded. Getting fired from the party wouldn't trigger that. So Anwar had space to deal with UMNO leaders who weren't Zahid to circumvent,"Dec 4, 2022"
@PerisaiPejuang,The only way for PN plus BN to stabilise after Zahid is if Bersatu and UMNO combine to become one party and the top leadership of Bersatu and UMNO somehow don't lose the seniority of their positions. Also need to address division level integration.,"Nov 22, 2022"
@PerisaiPejuang,"With this gov just recently giving the green light not to disband UMNO for contravening their own constitution, you and I know how Anwar will handle this even if Zahid is implicated and found guilty. When wrongdoings are overlooked it's just gonna be like a Najib held gov.",Mar 28
@PerisaiPejuang,"Yeah but what's at stake now? There was no racial riot. Agong's suggestion is just that, a suggestion. We're a democracy. And if some parties don't want to work with UMNO because of Zahid's kleptocracy then so be it",19h

@f15teen15,"Well I am sure I am not the only one who’s curious - if Zahid is convicted, and his UMNO withdraws their support for him, what’s going to happen? It’s a very big possibility, and this question was asked by Bloomberg. His answer was - we will cross that bridge when we get there.",Mar 4

@fadzilharith3,DS Ahmad Zahid Hamidi needs to continue to be the president of UMNO to avoid the possibility of things that could derail this Unity Government.

@fadzilharith3,"My opinion is slightly different from yours, tuan. what I want is UMNO to remain as it is.  For that, Zahid has proven that he is capable of defending UMNO's position without being used by PBBM or even Tun M. Likewise with Ahmad Maslan, it is not easy",Jun 4
@fadzilharith3,"Our hope is still on para perwakilan to wisely choose to form a strong team together with the leadership of Datuk Zahid Hamidi.

@fadzilharith3,"other, or others. Choose the least horrible. We cannot be an excuse for not telling the truth and our willingness to someone is not an incentive to say something that is not true. I will go for where UMNO is. I will plough on Zahid's leadership for now until najib bebas hahaha.",May 21
@fadzilharith3,what was said is exactly right.  UMNO reform should have been done as soon as the people rejected it during GE14.  It is not fair for us to turn our backs on a president who has only been in office for a few months.  New UMNO with No Najib No Zahid?  Don't dream!,"Dec 28, 2022"
