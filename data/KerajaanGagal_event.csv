@yvonneAPY,It was nerve-wracking when Dr Adham said that Covid-19 virus can be killed by drinking warm water on national tv. It was nerve-wracking when the longest lockdown was implemented & Emergency declared just to let Mahiaddin stay in power. #Covid19Malaysia #KerajaanGagal #RakyatIngat,"Nov 4, 2021"

@yvonneAPY,The motorist should appoint a lawyer to fight the case in court. It should be a message to the VVIPs that they are to endure the traffic condition in this country like everyone else. This may be a motivation for the VVIPs to improve the public transportation. #KERAjaanGagal,"May 10, 2022"
@yvonneAPY,The police should release the bank's name & address for the customers to check their accounts. This gives the impression that the police are protecting the corporates. We have no choice but to look to the socmed to name & shame the bank. #Covid19Malaysia #RakyatJagaRakyat,"Oct 26, 2021"
