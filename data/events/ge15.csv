@AKV9021,"And the alternative was? PN + BN 2.0. More Jana Wibawa, more Musa Aman's charges dropped. Would that be tackling corruption?

Tak nak Zahid, fine. Where's your better alternative after the GE15 hung Parliament? Let's hear it",15h
@AbdulAz67039163,"KJ as reference?
If there is GE to be held now, PN will not win any MP seats in Sgor. 
Pre & Post GE15 proved that PN is not as clean as everyone thought. 
They're seeking power just to continue the self-enrichment program, so-called Jana Wibawa.
We're saved.",Jun 5

@BellerophonC,"Directly to the state assemblyman, cc'ed to the MP and of course MB. Majlis in charge cannot be trusted at all. GE15 campaigning promises as usual have been discarded like rubbish.",Jun 11
@Capt_Mundy,He's still doesn't get the message from GE15 he's no longer wanted in politics. Now he's trying to cut up society into racial and religious blocks thinking he'll get the big cut. Nyanyok confirmed!,Jun 7
@CrossgateCentre,"If GE24 repeated GE15 & returned 56 SNP MPs it would not advance independence one iota before HR26. So stay at home in GE24 if there's no pro-Indy alternative to vote for, give them a bloody nose, & if they haven't signed up to Scotland United by HR26 replace them with ALBA/ISP.",Jun 8
@CrossgateCentre,So what? They said that after GE15 with 56 of Scotland's 59 MPs SNP.  What the English & their #VichyScot littler helpers would say about SNP WM losses is irrelevant to how pro-Indy Scotland votes in HR26 two years after NuSNP has been delivered a deserved bloody nose in GE24.,Jun 9

@Dhillon1138,Although it may be like that affirmative action based on race and diversity in education should be cancelled! It‚Äôs only brought shitty things esp in my society. The only one allowed should be income level so poor people are more likely to get help to college,Jun 10

@Dhillon1138,RIP time to have some airconds,Jun 11
@Dhillon1138,So a person whose party literally closed parliament and illegally revoked the emergency is talking about prosedure dan tatacara? How ironic,Jun 6
@Dhillon1138,Some wars are justified but not all. Esp the  Iraq and many of the colonial wars. So it shouldn‚Äôt be a main generator of the economy. I mean look at America when they invaded Vietnam and destroyed most of Indochina for basically no reason because they were scared of communism,Jun 5

@ForABetterMY,"Even in GE15, Dr M was steadfastly against the kleptocrats. Who has changed their stance though? All those times we heard Anwar worked with Najib/Zahid we thought were lies but is true. I bet you fear the ""green wave"". A made up wave.",Jun 8
@ForABetterMY,"I said this v thing about PH before GE15. After Sheraton Move, I saw how PH treated their voters.",Jun 7
@ForABetterMY,"Personally, I wouldn't take DAP's apology to mean much. I took it with a pinch of salt after GE15 because it was so lame. They couldn't apologise beforehand and refused to. 

The slippery slope began then. Principles they stood for? Wiped out. So I wouldn't want their apology.",Jun 8
@ForABetterMY,The slippery slop is like... GE15 was mid-Nov 2022 and how far has PH fallen? BN not so much because they've been in the bog for awhile.,Jun 5
@ForABetterMY,"There was never a need for Dr M to hand over the PM ship like a card. GE15 should happen for Anwar to have had a chance at being PM. But it is true, the Sheraton Move happened but not once did anyone from DAP or PH ask for GE15 immediately. Instead, they allowed piracy to fester",Jun 8
@HM_DaKieng,"@anwaribrahim
 himself must be more direct when confronting Sanusi. Anwar's FB post should be as spicy as Sanusi's posts, much like Rafizi's FB post before GE15.

@McGarmott,"GE15 showed them the possibility that the path to power in Malaysia lies not in the noisy, air-conned halls of Parlimen, but in the comfortingly filtered virtual chamber of social media.

There is nothing for PN in Parlimen anymore, except to be hijacked as a theatrical stage.",Jun 6
@PammellaJo,"she said its better if v the nons, liberals, the rationals the minorities together build a country on our own..separate frm them..like singapore..v made it happen in ge15..if v can make ph win..only wit our votes y nt v do this..thgs cant continue to b like this..",3h
@SathishSarma,"PH especially PKR should learn that no matter what they do PAS voters are not gonna change their votes. Especially it has been just around 6 to 7 months since GE15. Their political affiliation will not change in this short time.

PH should focus on governance.",Jun 12
@Terence5000,Is he still smoking pot or he failed maths big time during his schooling days ? ‚Ä¶. Even a 1st grader knows PH had the most seats in GE15.,Jun 4
@VurichDhu,Mind when you were on the stage at Bloomberg‚Äôs for the launch of your party‚Äôs ultra-lame Business Manifesto for GE15. I overheard a current shadow minister whisper to her pal that you looked hungover. I just thought you were crap ‚Ä¶ which one of us was right?,Jun 5

@alphaque,"Given that a very very large majority of non-Muslims voted PH, this is exactly what they want and deserve. 

Should have thought of the consequences before GE15, innit?

@emerhafiz,"it would be delusional to think that UMNO supporters unwilling to support PH especially when the other alternative (PN) is no less corrupted. 1/2 of the supporters protesting in GE15 voted PN, the other 1/2 remained loyal, will stay loyal & will vote BN-PH definitely",Jun 7
@imfsea_aruna,"Kudos...DJ KJ 
@Khairykj
 may join Bersatu and condemn UMNO. 
I can't think of any other valid reasons as to why DJ KJ may  join Bersatu which is a party full of traitors and betrayers. 
He is partyless and was defeated in GE15. 
It's like a vagabond seeking shelter.
Good luck",Jun 10
@jezlai,DAP Lim Guan Eng during GE15 campaign said if PH be the federal govt all highways tols be abolished. Apa macam Anwar dan Anthony Loke kenapa rakyat masih kena bayar tol?,6h
@jezlai,"This type of simply statement by Anwar truly disappoint PH voters in GE15 who trusted PH & Anwar to make immediate changes based on PH Manifesto and Promises made by Anwar, Rafizi, LKS, LGE, Sabu & PH leaders once Anwar is PM.

Hey Anwar & PH is this called a reformist statement?",Jun 9

@kevleety1,UMNO doesn't seem to understand that they are the ones that needs the votes from DAP supporters. Have they forgotten how badly they got trashed in GE15? So why the arrogance here? And I totally agree that DAP can take care of themselves. It is you that require the support of DAP.,Jun 9
@lfc_eddie,Actions were not taken against them when they were spewing all kinds of hate during GE15 and also when they were in power. Did that dent their chances of winning or elevate their standing as party who has the guts to champion the rights of the majority?,Jun 7
@mark__99__,"Because someone agreed to join force with PN after GE15, thinking that he could finally be Deputy Prime Minister, kakaka.",16h
@sayyedalifkhan,GE15 was a very unusual and unexpected outcome. The blessing is that it's a PH/UMNO Govt and not PN or PH/PN Govt  which if it was it will be acromonius. PH has to steer through a fine line to keep this Govt in place and compromises are to be expected to get to the bigger picture,Jun 9
@zach1ZA,"Actually the whole ‚ÄúPM shud not b Finance Minister‚Äù is a GE14 manifesto promise
